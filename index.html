        The Zebroid if the offspring of a very lucky Donkey and an unlucky Zebra.

        Zebroid is the term generally used for all zebra hybrids. The different hybrids are generally named using a
        portmanteau of the sire's name and the dam's name. Generally, no distinction is made as to which zebra species
        is used. Many times, when zebras are crossbred, they develop some form of dwarfism. Breeding of different
        branches of the equine family, which does not occur in the wild, generally results in infertile offspring. The
        combination of sire and dam also affects the offspring phenotype.

        A zorse is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a horse mare. This cross is also called a zebrula, zebrule, or
        zebra mule. The rarer reverse pairing is sometimes called a horbra, hebra, zebrinny, or zebret. Like most other
        animal hybrids, the zorse is sterile.

        A zony is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a pony mare. Medium-sized pony mares are preferred to produce
        riding zonies, but zebras have been crossed with smaller pony breeds such as the Shetland, resulting in
        so-called "Zetlands".
